# HYBRID SCHEDULER

## Submission for Microsoft Engage November 2021 üë©‚Äçüíª


Around 66% of the 18+ population of the country has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Schools, colleges, and institutions have started to finally open up. However, we also have to take essential measures to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 that‚Äôs where hybrid classes come into play.
Hybrid classes work in such a manner that half-strength would attend college/school and the same lecture would simultaneously be made available online for those attending lecture from their respective homes.



### PROBLEM
The problem that arise here is how to manage which student should come on which specific days, provided the number of students should not exceed the fixed number to maintain proper social distancing on each working day?
